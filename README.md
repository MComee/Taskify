## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the Taskify landing page up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js:** (LTS version recommended) - Includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd modern-business-landing-page
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository if applicable.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

To start the development server and view the application in your browser:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
